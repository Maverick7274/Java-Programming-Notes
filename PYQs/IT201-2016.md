# IT201 Question Paper 2014

## Section A

### 1. Discuss the criteria's for applying the concept of interface and abstract class in the context of Java programming. Take an appropriate programming example to support your criteria's

### Answer:

In Java programming, the choice between using an interface or an abstract class depends on several criteria. Here are the key considerations for applying the concept of an interface and an abstract class:

1. Level of Abstraction:
   - Interface: Interfaces provide the highest level of abstraction. They define a contract of behavior that a class must adhere to without specifying the implementation details. They focus on what a class can do, rather than how it does it.
   - Abstract Class: Abstract classes provide a higher level of abstraction compared to concrete classes but are less abstract than interfaces. They can define both abstract and non-abstract methods and can provide some default implementation. Abstract classes are useful when you want to share common behavior among related classes.

2. Inheritance and Code Reusability:
   - Interface: Interfaces support multiple inheritance, allowing a class to implement multiple interfaces. This promotes code reusability and enables a class to exhibit multiple types of behavior. Interfaces are useful when different classes need to share a common set of methods, irrespective of their hierarchical relationship.
   - Abstract Class: Abstract classes facilitate single inheritance, as a class can extend only one abstract class. They are beneficial when you want to provide a base class with common attributes and behavior to multiple derived classes. Abstract classes promote code reuse and enforce a common structure among related classes.

3. Use of Fields and Constructors:
   - Interface: Interfaces cannot have instance variables or constructors. They can only declare constants (static final fields).
   - Abstract Class: Abstract classes can have instance variables, constructors, and methods. They can hold shared state and provide common functionality to their subclasses.

4. Evolution and Compatibility:
   - Interface: Once an interface is defined, it cannot be changed without breaking compatibility with existing classes implementing it. Adding a new method to an existing interface requires modifying all implementing classes.
   - Abstract Class: Abstract classes can evolve over time by adding new methods or modifying existing ones without breaking compatibility with existing subclasses.

Example:

Let's consider the example of a geometric shape hierarchy. We have a base shape class called `Shape` with common attributes and behavior for all shapes. We want to calculate the area for each shape. We can define an abstract method `calculateArea()` in the `Shape` abstract class to be implemented by its subclasses. Additionally, we want to enforce a contract for shapes to be drawable, so we define an `Drawable` interface that declares a `draw()` method. 

```java
// Abstract class
abstract class Shape {
    protected String color;

    public Shape(String color) {
        this.color = color;
    }

    // Abstract method
    public abstract double calculateArea();
}

// Interface
interface Drawable {
    void draw();
}

// Concrete subclass
class Circle extends Shape implements Drawable {
    private double radius;

    public Circle(String color, double radius) {
        super(color);
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    public double calculateArea() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }

    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing a circle with radius: " + radius);
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Shape` abstract class provides a common structure for shapes and enforces the implementation of the `calculateArea()` method in its subclasses. The `Drawable` interface defines the contract for shapes to be drawable and requires the implementation of the `draw()` method.

By using the abstract class and interface together, we achieve code reusability and enforce a common behavior for the shape hierarchy. Subclasses of `Shape`, such as `Circle`, can implement the required methods and benefit from both the shared structure of the abstract class and the contract of the interface.

### 2 (a) Discuss the various types of access protection policies of packages in JAVA.

### (b) Identify and list the errors if any in the following interfaces ? Also fix the errors if found.

```java
public interface SomethingisWrong {
    void aMethod(int aValue) {
        System.out. println("Hi Mom"); 
    }
}
```

### Answer:

(a)
In Java, access protection policies are used to control the visibility and accessibility of classes, interfaces, and members within a package. There are four access levels available for packages:

1. Public Access:
   - Classes, interfaces, and members with public access are accessible from anywhere, both within and outside the package.
   - They can be accessed by other packages, including those outside the current project.
   - To declare a class or interface as public, use the `public` modifier.

2. Protected Access:
   - Classes, interfaces, and members with protected access are accessible within the same package and by subclasses outside the package.
   - Protected members can be inherited and accessed by subclasses, even if the subclass is in a different package.
   - To declare a class, interface, or member as protected, use the `protected` modifier.

3. Default (Package-private) Access:
   - Classes, interfaces, and members with default access, also known as package-private access, are accessible within the same package.
   - They are not accessible outside the package, even by subclasses.
   - If no access modifier is specified, it is considered the default access level.

4. Private Access:
   - Private access is the most restrictive access level.
   - Classes, interfaces, and members with private access are only accessible within the same class.
   - They are not accessible by any other class, even subclasses.
   - To declare a member as private, use the `private` modifier.

These access protection policies are essential for encapsulation and maintaining the integrity of the codebase. They allow developers to control the visibility of classes, interfaces, and members, preventing unauthorized access and providing a clear boundary for code organization.

It's important to note that access control is not limited to packages alone. Access modifiers can also be used for individual class members (fields, methods, constructors), allowing fine-grained control over their accessibility within the package and subclasses.

Example:

Consider a package named `com.example` that contains two classes, `PublicClass` and `DefaultClass`, and an interface `PublicInterface`.

```java
package com.example;

public class PublicClass {
    public void publicMethod() {
        // Code goes here
    }
}

class DefaultClass {
    public void defaultMethod() {
        // Code goes here
    }
}

public interface PublicInterface {
    void publicInterfaceMethod();
}
```

In this example, `PublicClass` is declared with the `public` access modifier, making it accessible from anywhere, including outside the package `com.example`. `DefaultClass` is not explicitly declared with an access modifier, which means it has the default (package-private) access level and is accessible only within the `com.example` package. `PublicInterface` is declared with the `public` access modifier, allowing it to be used by other packages.

By using different access protection policies, you can control the visibility and accessibility of classes, interfaces, and members within your packages, ensuring proper encapsulation and maintaining the desired level of access control in your Java codebase.

(b)

The given interface has the following errors:

1. The method `aMethod(int aValue)` has a body, which is not allowed in an interface. Interfaces only declare method signatures, not the implementation.

To fix the errors, remove the method body and semicolon after the method declaration:

```java
public interface SomethingisWrong {
    void aMethod(int aValue);
}
```

Now the interface `SomethingisWrong` correctly declares a method `aMethod` without an implementation.

### 3. If multiple threads are running concurrently then during their communication the synchronization problem may occur, so discuss the ways to resolve the problem with suitable example?

### Answer:


When multiple threads are running concurrently and accessing shared resources, synchronization issues can arise. To resolve such problems, Java provides several mechanisms for thread synchronization. Here are some common ways to address synchronization problems:

1. Synchronized Methods:
   - You can use the `synchronized` keyword to declare a method as synchronized. Only one thread can execute a synchronized method at a time, ensuring thread-safety.
   - Synchronization is achieved by acquiring an intrinsic lock (also known as a monitor lock) on the object's instance.
   - Here's an example:

   ```java
   public class Counter {
       private int count;

       public synchronized void increment() {
           count++;
       }
   }
   ```

2. Synchronized Blocks:
   - You can use synchronized blocks to synchronize a specific section of code, rather than an entire method.
   - Synchronized blocks require a lock object that threads need to acquire before executing the block of code.
   - Here's an example:

   ```java
   public class Counter {
       private int count;
       private Object lock = new Object();

       public void increment() {
           synchronized (lock) {
               count++;
           }
       }
   }
   ```

3. ReentrantLock:
   - The `ReentrantLock` class provides an alternative to synchronized blocks and methods.
   - It allows more flexible locking operations and advanced features like fairness and condition variables.
   - Here's an example:

   ```java
   import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

   public class Counter {
       private int count;
       private ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

       public void increment() {
           lock.lock();
           try {
               count++;
           } finally {
               lock.unlock();
           }
       }
   }
   ```

4. Atomic Classes:
   - Java provides atomic classes, such as `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicLong`, etc., which offer atomic operations on shared variables without the need for explicit synchronization.
   - These classes internally use low-level synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread-safety.
   - Here's an example:

   ```java
   import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

   public class Counter {
       private AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger();

       public void increment() {
           count.incrementAndGet();
       }
   }
   ```

These synchronization techniques ensure that only one thread can access the shared resource at a time, preventing race conditions and ensuring data integrity. By choosing the appropriate synchronization mechanism based on the specific requirements of your application, you can effectively resolve synchronization problems in concurrent programming.

### 4. AWT components are few challenges such as look and feel, speed and memory. Is there any other alternative component available to handle these challenges ? Also discuss how that component better then AWT component.

### Answer:

Yes, an alternative to AWT components in Java is Swing. Swing provides a more advanced and flexible set of components compared to AWT, addressing the challenges faced by AWT components. Here's how Swing overcomes those challenges:

1. Look and Feel:
   - Swing components have a pluggable look and feel (PLAF) architecture, which allows applications to have a consistent appearance across different platforms.
   - Swing provides a range of look and feel options, such as Metal, Windows, Motif, and Nimbus, allowing developers to customize the visual style of their applications.
   - This flexibility in look and feel enhances the user experience and makes Swing applications visually appealing.

2. Speed:
   - Swing components are lightweight compared to AWT components, resulting in faster rendering and improved performance.
   - Swing components are written entirely in Java and are not dependent on native platform resources, eliminating the overhead of native calls and improving speed.
   - Swing also utilizes various optimization techniques, such as double buffering, to minimize flickering and provide smooth rendering.

3. Memory:
   - Swing components consume less memory compared to AWT components, contributing to improved memory efficiency.
   - Swing components have a consistent and optimized internal architecture, resulting in reduced memory footprint.
   - Swing also provides features like lazy instantiation and recycling of internal resources, further optimizing memory usage.

4. Rich Feature Set:
   - Swing offers a wide range of additional components that were not available in AWT, such as advanced controls, tables, trees, tabbed panes, and more.
   - Swing provides support for more interactive and user-friendly features, including drag and drop, toolbars, progress bars, and customizable dialogs.
   - Swing also offers advanced layout managers that enable flexible component arrangement and responsive user interfaces.

Overall, Swing provides a superior alternative to AWT components by addressing the challenges of look and feel customization, speed, and memory consumption. It offers a rich feature set, better performance, and a more modern and appealing appearance, making it a preferred choice for developing graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Java.

### 5. Discuss the event delegation model in Java. Also explain the basic components of it.

### Answer:

The event delegation model in Java is a design pattern used to handle events in a GUI-based application. In this model, the responsibility for processing and handling events is delegated to appropriate event listeners rather than being handled directly by the source of the event. The event delegation model follows the principle of separation of concerns and promotes modular and extensible event handling.

Basic components of the event delegation model:

1. Event Sources:
   - Event sources are the objects that generate events. Examples of event sources in Java are buttons, menus, text fields, etc.
   - Event sources are responsible for capturing and dispatching events to appropriate event listeners.

2. Event Objects:
   - Event objects encapsulate information about a specific event. They carry details such as the type of event, the source of the event, and any additional data related to the event.
   - In Java, each type of event has a corresponding event class. For example, `ActionEvent` represents an action event, `MouseEvent` represents a mouse event, etc.

3. Event Listeners:
   - Event listeners are the objects that listen and respond to specific types of events. They implement specific listener interfaces provided by Java, such as `ActionListener`, `MouseListener`, etc.
   - Event listeners define callback methods that are invoked when the corresponding events occur.
   - Each event listener can be registered with one or more event sources to receive events from those sources.

4. Event Dispatching:
   - When an event occurs, the event source dispatches the event to all registered event listeners.
   - The event source invokes the appropriate callback method(s) defined in the event listener interface(s).
   - The event object is passed as a parameter to the callback method, providing the necessary information about the event.

Benefits of the event delegation model:

1. Separation of Concerns:
   - The event delegation model separates the responsibilities of event generation (event sources) and event handling (event listeners), promoting cleaner and more maintainable code.
   - It allows developers to focus on specific event-related logic in separate event listener implementations.

2. Flexibility and Extensibility:
   - The event delegation model allows easy addition or removal of event listeners without modifying the event source code.
   - It enables multiple event listeners to respond to the same event, facilitating modular and extensible event handling.

3. Code Reusability:
   - Event listeners can be reused across multiple event sources that generate similar types of events.
   - This promotes code reuse and reduces duplication of event handling code.

Overall, the event delegation model in Java provides a structured and efficient approach to handle events in GUI applications. It promotes modular design, separation of concerns, and code reusability, making event handling more manageable and flexible.

### 6. Differentiate between:

### (a) this and super

### (b) final, finally and finalize

### (c) String and StringBuffer

### Answer:

(a) Difference between `this` and `super`:

|        | `this`        | `super`           |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Usage  | Refers to the current object instance within a class | Refers to the superclass or parent class |
| Scope  | Can be used within instance methods and constructors | Can be used within subclasses to access superclass members |
| Purpose | Used to differentiate between instance variables and parameters/locals with the same name | Used to access or invoke superclass members (methods, fields, or constructors) |
| Example | `this.variableName` or `this.methodName()` | `super.methodName()` or `super.variableName` |


(b) Difference between `final`, `finally`, and `finalize`:

|        | `final`       | `finally`        | `finalize`       |
|--------|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| Purpose | Keyword used to declare a constant, make a method not overrideable, or a class not inheritable | Block used in exception handling to execute code regardless of whether an exception occurs or not | Method called by the garbage collector before reclaiming an object's memory |
| Usage  | Used to define a constant value, prevent method overriding, or prevent class inheritance | Used as part of the try-catch-finally statement to define code that must be executed | Not directly used by programmers, automatically called by the garbage collector |
| Example | `final int NUM = 10;` or `final void methodName() { ... }` | `try { ... } catch (Exception e) { ... } finally { ... }` | Not directly invoked, handled by the garbage collector |


(c) Difference between `String` and `StringBuffer`:

|        | `String`      | `StringBuffer`   |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| Mutability | Immutable - Cannot be changed once created | Mutable - Can be modified after creation |
| Performance | Creating a new string involves creating a new object, which can be inefficient for frequent modifications | More efficient for frequent modifications, as it allows in-place modifications without creating new objects |
| Thread-safety | String objects are immutable and inherently thread-safe | StringBuffer objects are mutable but synchronized, ensuring thread-safety |
| Usage  | Suitable for situations where the content is not expected to change frequently | Suitable for situations where frequent modifications to the content are required, such as string concatenation in loops |
| Example | `String str = "Hello";` | `StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("Hello");` |

Note: In modern versions of Java, it is recommended to use `StringBuilder` instead of `StringBuffer` in non-threaded scenarios where synchronization is not required, as `StringBuilder` provides similar functionality but without the overhead of synchronization.

## Section B


### 7. (a) An University has applied promotion criteria for students. According to criteria a student cannot promote to next academic year if he have less than 4.5 CGPA. A developer is trying to implement this situation using exception handling in JAVA. Write a correct Java code to help him.

### (b) A palindrome is a string that is spelled the same way backward and forward. For example, mom, dad, radar, 727 are all examples of palindromes. Write a program that lets the user type a word and then determines whether the string is a palindrome.

### Answer:

(a)

Certainly! Here's a Java code example that demonstrates how to implement the promotion criteria using exception handling:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class PromotionCriteria {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.println("Enter student's CGPA:");
        double cgpa = scanner.nextDouble();

        try {
            promoteStudent(cgpa);
            System.out.println("Student is eligible for promotion.");
        } catch (PromotionException e) {
            System.out.println("PromotionException: " + e.getMessage());
            System.out.println("Student is not eligible for promotion.");
        }
    }

    public static void promoteStudent(double cgpa) throws PromotionException {
        if (cgpa < 4.5) {
            throw new PromotionException("CGPA is less than 4.5");
        }
    }
}

class PromotionException extends Exception {
    public PromotionException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

In the above code, we define a `PromotionCriteria` class that contains the `main` method. The user is prompted to enter the student's CGPA. The `promoteStudent` method is called to check if the student is eligible for promotion. If the CGPA is less than 4.5, we throw a custom `PromotionException`. 

In the `main` method, we wrap the `promoteStudent` method call in a try-catch block. If an exception is thrown, we catch the `PromotionException`, display an error message, and indicate that the student is not eligible for promotion. Otherwise, if no exception is thrown, we display a message stating that the student is eligible for promotion.

Note: In this example, we have used a custom `PromotionException` class to handle the specific exception scenario. You can further customize the exception class as per your requirements.


(b)
Certainly! Here's a Java program that checks if a given word is a palindrome or not:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class PalindromeChecker {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter a word: ");
        String word = scanner.nextLine();

        if (isPalindrome(word)) {
            System.out.println("The word is a palindrome.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("The word is not a palindrome.");
        }
    }

    public static boolean isPalindrome(String word) {
        // Remove any spaces and convert the word to lowercase
        word = word.replaceAll("\\s+", "").toLowerCase();

        int length = word.length();
        for (int i = 0; i < length / 2; i++) {
            if (word.charAt(i) != word.charAt(length - 1 - i)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

In this program, we take input from the user using the `Scanner` class and store it in the `word` variable. The `isPalindrome` method is used to check if the word is a palindrome.

The `isPalindrome` method performs the following steps:
1. Removes any spaces from the word using the `replaceAll` method.
2. Converts the word to lowercase using the `toLowerCase` method.
3. Iterates over the characters of the word from both ends simultaneously, comparing the characters.
4. If any pair of characters does not match, it returns `false` indicating that the word is not a palindrome.
5. If all pairs of characters match, it returns `true` indicating that the word is a palindrome.

Finally, based on the result of the `isPalindrome` method, the program displays the appropriate message to the user.

### 8. (a) Explain the life cycle of a thread, also write a program to find the factorial of range 1-10 using two threads.

### (b) Explain Life Cycle of an Applet in Java with suitable example.

### Answer:

(a)
The life cycle of a thread in Java can be divided into several stages:

1. New: The thread is in the new state when it is created but has not yet started executing. At this stage, the thread is not yet eligible for execution.

2. Runnable: The thread enters the runnable state when the `start()` method is called. The thread is now eligible for execution by the scheduler. However, it does not necessarily mean that the thread is currently executing. It is up to the scheduler to decide when to run the thread.

3. Running: The thread enters the running state when the scheduler selects it for execution. The actual execution of the thread's code takes place in this stage.

4. Blocked/Waiting: The thread enters the blocked or waiting state when it is temporarily paused or put on hold. This can occur when the thread is waiting for a resource, waiting for I/O operations, or waiting for a notification from another thread.

5. Terminated: The thread enters the terminated state when it finishes its execution or when an exception occurs that is not caught. Once a thread is terminated, it cannot be restarted.

Here's a Java program that calculates the factorial of numbers from 1 to 10 using two threads:

```java
public class FactorialCalculator implements Runnable {
    private int number;

    public FactorialCalculator(int number) {
        this.number = number;
    }

    public void run() {
        long factorial = calculateFactorial(number);
        System.out.println("Factorial of " + number + " is: " + factorial);
    }

    private long calculateFactorial(int n) {
        long factorial = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            factorial *= i;
        }
        return factorial;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread1 = new Thread(new FactorialCalculator(5));
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(new FactorialCalculator(10));

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();
    }
}
```

In this program, the `FactorialCalculator` class implements the `Runnable` interface, which allows the class to be executed by a thread. The `run()` method contains the code that will be executed when the thread starts.

In the `run()` method, the `calculateFactorial()` method is called to calculate the factorial of the given number. The result is then printed to the console.

In the `main()` method, two threads are created using the `Thread` class, each with a different number to calculate the factorial. The `start()` method is called on each thread to start their execution. As a result, the factorial of 5 and 10 will be calculated concurrently by two separate threads.

(b)
The life cycle of an applet in Java consists of several stages, from initialization to termination. Here's a detailed explanation of the life cycle stages:

1. Initialization: When an applet is loaded, the `init()` method is called. This method is responsible for initializing the applet and setting up any necessary resources. It is called only once during the lifetime of the applet.

2. Start: After the initialization, the `start()` method is called. This method is used to start the execution of the applet. It is called every time the applet is accessed or when it regains focus after being paused or stopped.

3. Paint: The `paint()` method is called after the `start()` method. It is responsible for drawing the applet's graphical user interface (GUI) on the screen. The `paint()` method is called whenever the applet needs to be visually updated, such as when it is first displayed, resized, or uncovered after being covered by another window.

4. Stop: The `stop()` method is called when the applet loses focus or is covered by another window. It is used to suspend any ongoing activities or animations in the applet. The `stop()` method is also called when the applet is about to be destroyed.

5. Destroy: The `destroy()` method is called when the applet is no longer needed or when the web page containing the applet is closed. It is responsible for cleaning up any resources used by the applet, such as closing files or releasing memory.

Here's an example demonstrating the life cycle of an applet:

```java
import java.applet.Applet;
import java.awt.Graphics;

public class MyExampleApplet extends Applet {
    public void init() {
        // Initialization code
    }

    public void start() {
        // Start code
    }

    public void paint(Graphics g) {
        // GUI drawing code
    }

    public void stop() {
        // Stop code
    }

    public void destroy() {
        // Cleanup code
    }
}
```

In this example, we define an applet called `MyExampleApplet` that extends the `Applet` class. The `init()`, `start()`, `paint()`, `stop()`, and `destroy()` methods are overridden to provide the desired functionality at each stage of the applet's life cycle.

In the `init()` method, you can perform any necessary initialization tasks, such as setting up variables or loading resources. The `start()` method can be used to start any ongoing activities or animations. The `paint()` method is responsible for drawing the applet's GUI. The `stop()` method is used to pause or stop any ongoing activities, and the `destroy()` method is called when the applet is about to be destroyed to clean up any resources.

By implementing these methods and defining the appropriate code within each method, you can control the behavior of your applet throughout its life cycle.

### 9. (a) Design an applet to demonstrate the smiley Applet.

### (b) In a School class, there are three major subjects : Physics, Chemistry and Math. The faculty has evaluated the result and stored in a text files named "Physics.txt", "Chemistry.txt" and "Maths.txt", respectively. Write a Java program to publish the result in another text file named "Result.txt", it will contain the percentage marks obtained be summing the marks of the subjects.


### Answer:

(a)

```java
import java.applet.Applet;
import java.awt.Color;
import java.awt.Graphics;

public class SmileyApplet extends Applet {
    public void paint(Graphics g) {
        // Set background color
        setBackground(Color.white);

        // Draw face
        g.setColor(Color.yellow);
        g.fillOval(50, 50, 200, 200);

        // Draw eyes
        g.setColor(Color.black);
        g.fillOval(100, 100, 40, 40);
        g.fillOval(180, 100, 40, 40);

        // Draw mouth
        g.setColor(Color.black);
        g.drawArc(100, 150, 120, 80, 0, -180);
    }
}
```

In this applet, the `paint()` method is overridden to draw the smiley face. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. Set the background color of the applet using `setBackground()`. In this example, we set it to white.

2. Draw the face using `fillOval()`. We set the color to yellow and specify the coordinates and dimensions of the oval to create a circular face.

3. Draw the eyes using `fillOval()`. We set the color to black and specify the coordinates and dimensions to create two small circles for the eyes.

4. Draw the mouth using `drawArc()`. We set the color to black and specify the coordinates, dimensions, and start/end angles to create a curved mouth.

When you run the applet, you should see a smiley face displayed on the screen. You can customize the colors, positions, and dimensions of the different elements to create variations of the smiley face.

Certainly! Here's a Java program that reads the marks from the individual subject files, calculates the percentage, and writes the result to another file:

```java
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.BufferedWriter;
import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ResultPublisher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // File paths
        String physicsFile = "Physics.txt";
        String chemistryFile = "Chemistry.txt";
        String mathsFile = "Maths.txt";
        String resultFile = "Result.txt";

        // Read marks from subject files
        int physicsMarks = readMarksFromFile(physicsFile);
        int chemistryMarks = readMarksFromFile(chemistryFile);
        int mathsMarks = readMarksFromFile(mathsFile);

        // Calculate percentage
        double totalMarks = physicsMarks + chemistryMarks + mathsMarks;
        double percentage = (totalMarks / 300) * 100;

        // Write result to file
        writeResultToFile(resultFile, percentage);
    }

    // Method to read marks from file
    public static int readMarksFromFile(String filePath) {
        int marks = 0;

        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {
            String line = reader.readLine();
            marks = Integer.parseInt(line);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        return marks;
    }

    // Method to write result to file
    public static void writeResultToFile(String filePath, double percentage) {
        try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(filePath))) {
            writer.write("Percentage: " + percentage + "%");
            System.out.println("Result published successfully!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

Make sure to place the subject files ("Physics.txt", "Chemistry.txt", "Maths.txt") in the same directory as the Java program file. The program reads the marks from each subject file, calculates the percentage, and writes the result to "Result.txt" in the format "Percentage: XX%".

Note: This program assumes that the subject files contain only one line with the marks. Make sure to format the files accordingly before running the program.
